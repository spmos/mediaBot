The Best and Worst Foods Before Bedtime!
Benenden Health professionals have revealed the best and worst things you can snack on before falling asleep, as well as how nighttime eating affects the quality of our sleep. Some of these might surprise you. Of course, whenever possible, you should avoid eating late at night and steer clear of stimulants like coffee and sugar. Sleep experts shared the following: 'Eat something before your body begins to relax. Going to bed on an empty stomach lowers blood sugar levels and interferes with the body's ability to sleep well.'

The Worst Foods Before Bed:
- Chocolate
  It's no secret that chocolate isn't the best late-night snack, mainly due to its high caffeine and sugar content. Professionals explain: 'During the later stages of sleep, caffeine consumption can cause more frequent occurrences of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, making you more likely to feel dizzy in the morning.'

- Cheese
  While the idea that eating cheese before bed leads to bad dreams may be a myth, there are other reasons to keep this tasty food away at night. 'Strong or aged cheeses, as well as preserved meats like bacon, ham, and pepperoni, naturally contain high levels of the amino acid tyramine, which makes us feel alert,' according to experts. 'Tyramine causes the adrenal glands to release the 'fight or flight' hormone, which increases alertness for several hours,' they add.

- Curry
  Although a late-night curry might sound tempting, it's best to plan it earlier in the evening. Generally, spicy foods should be avoided. Professionals explain this is due to high levels of capsaicin. 'This chemical increases body temperature by interfering with the body's thermoregulation process, which in turn disrupts sleep,' they note. Your body will use more energy to digest the spices, making the possibility of a good night's sleep a distant dream.

- Ice Cream
  The idea of a big scoop of your favorite ice cream may be just right to accompany any movie you're watching before bed, but it will disrupt your sleep pattern. Extra sugary foods like ice cream should be avoided once it gets dark. They can raise your blood sugar levels, which then inevitably crash once you fall asleep. 'The blood sugar crash alerts the adrenal glands that there is an emergency, which in turn raises cortisol levels and wakes the body from sleep,' say sleep professionals.

- Potato Chips
  A small pack of potato chips before bed might be exactly what you wanted, but it's the last thing you need. In fact, they are 'some of the worst foods to eat before bed as they contribute to disturbed—or 'shallow'—sleep.' Try to avoid salty snacks for the three hours before bedtime.

The Best Foods Before Bed:

While eating before bed is generally not recommended, there are certain foods that can help you fall asleep.

- Cherries
  This fruity snack is excellent if you feel hungry before bed. Cherries contain melatonin, making them the perfect food for a late-night snack if you want a longer, deeper sleep.

- Raw Honey
  Like cherries, honey is another great pre-bedtime snack. Specifically, professionals say: 'Honey stimulates melatonin and deactivates orexin in the body: the neuropeptide that makes us feel alert. A cup of warm water, lemon, and honey is an excellent evening drink for soothing the body and inducing sleep.'

- Bananas
  While bananas are considered a perfect snack at any time of the day, they are particularly good before bed. Their high magnesium levels mean they naturally relax your body's muscles, facilitating your relaxation as well. Bananas are a good choice if you want to eat something before bed.

- Turkey
  Turkey is not just great for your Sunday roast but can also encourage a great night's sleep. 'This is because turkey is high in tryptophan: an essential amino acid that acts as a natural mood regulator.' Tryptophan can help calm the body and manage anxiety, aiding in a peaceful sleep. 'Brown rice, fish, and yogurt also contain high levels of this calming amino acid, making them some of the best foods for sleep,' they add.

- Almonds
  While you should avoid almonds if they are part of a sugary snack like a muffin, on their own, they work well for encouraging sleep due to their magnesium content. According to sleep experts: 'Magnesium is great for regulating our blood sugar levels as we sleep, meaning the body naturally transitions from the adrenaline cycle to what is known as the rest and digest cycle.'
