 Deep Sleep: 5+1 Tips for Better Sleep

Most of us now have the ability to easily monitor our sleep patterns and see how well we are sleeping through various smartphone apps or simply through our smartwatches. How many of you have been tempted to check your sleep chart daily, realizing that something needs to change?

 Deep Sleep: What It Means and Its Benefits

Deep sleep is the third stage of sleep, without rapid eye movement (non-REM). It is widely known as slow-wave sleep because during this time, our brain waves are at their slowest. Deep sleep consists of three stages and lasts 45-90 minutes in the overall sleep cycle. Our body gradually transitions from alertness and high brain activity to deep sleep.

During deep sleep, according to scientists at the Cleveland Clinic, the human body goes through several cycles of deep sleep throughout the night, with these periods decreasing as dawn approaches. Dr. Nicole Avena, a Neuroscience Doctor at New York Medical University, emphasizes that during this time, 'our brain has the least possible activity.'

Deep sleep has significant benefits for our body and especially for our brain. Through deep sleep, our body recovers its strength, literally rests from daily stress, and thus wakes up with more energy and clarity. During deep sleep, 'blood pressure is steady, allowing the body to improve physically and psychologically,' adds Dr. Avena, noting that this helps maintain a strong immune system. Additionally, deep sleep addresses muscle issues, develops bones, regulates hormones, and effectively contributes to the body's detoxification.

During the deep sleep stage, the human brain also benefits by processing and consolidating memories. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, about 13% to 23% of our sleep should be deep, which translates to about 1 to 2 hours of deep sleep if we get the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep.

On the flip side, not sleeping well for many years (chronic sleep deprivation) and having issues with deep sleep can increase the risk of obesity, diabetes, depression, cardiovascular diseases, and high blood pressure.

 5+1 Tips for Deep Sleep

The secret to waking up refreshed, without an alarm clock, and full of energy for the new day lies in these 6 tips!

1. Go to Bed Early/Earlier: Early enough to achieve, depending on when you wake up, the average of eight hours of sleep, and earlier if you find it hard to fall asleep with the same 8-hour rest goal.
   
2. Avoid Alcohol, Caffeine, and Heavy Meals Before Bed: It is advisable to finish your evening meal about two hours before bedtime, while afternoon caffeine is considered a hindrance to good sleep. As for alcohol, we all know that excesses do not aid any normal bodily function, including sleep.

3. Exercise Regularly: Regular, systematic, and ideally daily exercise - even for a few minutes - contributes to better sleep at night. The body is more tired, has released the day's tension, and can now 'recover.'

4. Separate from Screens Before Bed: Mobile phones, tablets, and TVs are now proven to harm sleep quality and cause insomnia. Ideally, we avoid screens for an hour before bedtime.

5. Implement Recognized Sleep Practices Daily: These include appropriately setting up the sleeping area, having low lighting, a clean and calm environment, and maintaining a consistent bedtime daily.

6. Pay Attention to Your Mattress and Find the Ideal One for You!

 The Right Mattress for Restful, Deep Sleep

Discomfort in any part of the body significantly impacts sleep quality and can even lead to chronic insomnia. This physical discomfort causes us to sleep less and less deeply, affecting overall health. But what is the right mattress?

A mattress that aids deep sleep stays cool but not cold. If the mattress retains too much heat, it will cause sweat buildup, making sleep difficult. For the climate conditions of Greece, spring mattresses are the most recommended, as sleeping on them has been shown to be up to 28% cooler than on an all-foam mattress (Kansas State University & the Institute of Environmental Research).

Additionally, your mattress should be new or recently changed. Older mattresses have worn spots or tears that may cause skin irritation or itching, preventing the body from relaxing. If your mattress is over seven years old with daily use, it's time to replace it!

A mattress that supports deep sleep is one that conforms to the natural curves of the body, so it doesn't put pressure on the shoulders or hips. If you don't sleep as well as before, if it takes you a long time to get comfortable after lying down for a while, or if you wake up with a tired body or feel stiff, the mattress affects your sleep quality.

 The Right Mattress Contributes to Deep Sleep

Moreover, you should choose a mattress that meets your specific needs. This selection is personalized, depending on any muscle issues. For example, a mattress with dips or inclines can hit all the wrong pressure points. Waking up every day with the same pain in the same spot is usually a sign of this problem. Lumps or depressions may cause pain and even affect your dreams. Your brain might create scenarios where you escape from painful or traumatic events, causing you to wake up in the middle of REM.

Deep sleep requires the right mattress. Otherwise, physical discomfort prevents you from sleeping or reaching deep sleep. It may also interrupt sleep, leading again to non-deep sleep.
