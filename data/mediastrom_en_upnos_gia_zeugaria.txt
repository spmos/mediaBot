 Good Sleep: Secrets from Generation Z and a Study on Couples and Sleep

 Sleeping with a Partner is Healthier than Sleeping Alone

Sleeping with a partner or spouse is much healthier than sleeping alone, providing significant physical and mental health benefits. However, sleeping with a child can be detrimental, according to a study.

The findings of this study, published by researchers from the University of Arizona in the peer-reviewed journal Sleep, explored the benefits of sleeping with someone else as well as the exceptions.

Adults should sleep a total of seven to nine hours, and older adults should aim for seven to eight hours. Poor sleep habits increase the risk of chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and more.

Despite many people preferring to sleep with a partner for various reasons, a comprehensive study on the health benefits of co-sleeping had not been conducted. In this research, the researchers analyzed data from 1,007 working-age adults in Pennsylvania.

 Findings

Overall, sleeping with a partner or spouse was found to significantly improve sleep quality. Insomnia was less severe, sleep duration was longer, fatigue was reduced, and there was a lower risk of sleep apnea, a respiratory disorder. Additionally, co-sleeping led to less anxiety and lower levels of depression while strengthening the couple's relationship.

Conversely, those who slept alone suffered from more insomnia, increased fatigue and daytime sleepiness, and a higher risk of sleep apnea. They also experienced more anxiety and depression. 

Sleeping with a child, on the other hand, was linked to more stress, a higher risk of sleep apnea, and insomnia.

In summary, sleep is important, yet many people do not get enough of it. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at least one-third of adults do not get sufficient sleep. Therefore, finding a sleeping partner might be beneficial for your physical and mental health.

3 Secrets of Generation Z for Good Sleep

Although the new generation, aged 18-24, is often glued to social media and TikTok and tends to sleep a lot, they also have some good ideas for better sleep.

If you have sleep problems—not just insomnia but various other issues—welcome to the world of Gen Z. Many factors can prevent you from enjoying restful sleep, including stress, uncomfortable bedding, or disturbances like noisy neighbors.

The secret of Generation Z is simply a routine.

This is not new, as routines are their trademark. Whether it’s becoming the 'That Girl' of TikTok or improving fitness, it’s all about routine. 

A routine helps manage the fast pace of modern life, ensuring proper planning. The same applies to sleep. Gen Z dedicates time to preparing for sleep, including listening to music, using ASMR techniques (special videos with soothing sounds), skincare routines, and meticulous teeth brushing.

Some also check social media before bed, but experts recommend avoiding screens before sleep as electronic devices can cause irritation and disrupt sleep.

Three Key Rules for a Perfect Sleep Routine According to Gen Z

1. Create Your Personal Routine
   - Start with a warm shower, apply a face mask, prepare your clothes for the next day, or review your schedule.
   - Personal care is essential for both morning and night routines.
   - Maintain a consistent bedtime, even on weekends when possible.

2. Care for Your Space
   - Keep your room tidy, dark, and at a stable temperature.
   - Avoid strong room scents or flowers, as they can be unhealthy and cause sleeplessness.

3. Don’t Stress if You Can’t Sleep
   - If you’re not sleepy, don’t force yourself to sleep. 
   - Stay relaxed, watch a movie, read a book, or listen to music.
   - Stop counting sheep, as it stimulates the brain rather than calming it.
