 Tips for Better Sleep Hygiene

 The Impact of Sleep Deprivation
Scientific research has shown that sleep deprivation can lead to several undesirable medical conditions, including heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, obesity, and depression. Loving yourself and your health also means loving your sleep!

While it might be easier said than done, sleep scientists recommend following a 'protocol' of simple rules to establish good sleep hygiene. This ideal sleep hygiene is based on four pillars: Behavior, Environment, Diet, and Exercise.

 BEHAVIOR
1. Consistent Sleep Schedule: Try to maintain a regular sleep schedule, going to bed and waking up at the same times every day, regardless of the day of the week.
2. Bedtime Routine: Establish a pre-sleep routine to prepare your mind and body for sleep. This could include listening to relaxing music, having calm conversations, spending some quiet time alone, taking a warm bath with a few drops of essential oils, or inhaling the pleasant aroma of sleep-friendly essential oils like jasmine, bergamot, lavender, marjoram oil, vanilla, ylang-ylang, sandalwood, and valerian. Drinking a cup of chamomile tea before bed can also help you relax and sleep more easily.
3. Bedroom Use: Use your bedroom only for sleeping and cuddling before sleep. Avoid eating, watching TV, or working on a tablet/laptop one to two hours before bed. When you feel sleepy, go to bed immediately without delay.
4. Limit Wake Time in Bed: If you are awake in bed for 15-20 minutes, get up and leave the bedroom.
5. Avoid Naps: Refrain from taking naps 6-8 hours before bedtime.

 ENVIRONMENT
1. Sleep-Friendly Bedroom: Create a sleep-friendly bedroom environment. A very bright room can make it hard to sleep. If your curtains let in daylight as soon as dawn breaks, opt for blackout curtains or rollers.
2. Ideal Temperature: Avoid excessive heat. Maintain a comfortable temperature in your room.
3. Noise Reduction: Minimize loud noises. If you are easily disturbed by noise or live in a busy area, consider using earplugs (but avoid them if you have children at home who might need you during the night).
4. Minimal Decoration: Limit excessive decoration in your bedroom to avoid dust accumulation and potential allergens that can disrupt your sleep due to sneezing, breathing difficulties, or coughing.

 DIET
1. Limit Caffeine: Avoid caffeine 6-8 hours before bedtime. This includes chocolate, tea, and coffee. Ideally, limit your daily intake to 1-2 cups of coffee.
2. Avoid Alcohol: Refrain from consuming alcohol 3-5 hours before bed. While alcohol might make you feel sleepy, it leads to poor-quality sleep.
3. Light Evening Snacks: Avoid heavy meals shortly before bed, but also donâ€™t go to bed completely hungry. A light snack with carbohydrates can help, but avoid large meals and sweets.

 EXERCISE
1. Regular Exercise: Regular exercise improves sleep quality. Incorporate moderate to intense exercise for 20-30 minutes several days a week. Research shows that after four months of exercise, people with insomnia slept 85 more minutes each night, significantly improving their lives.
2. Timing of Exercise: Avoid intense exercise 3-5 hours before bed. If you want to do some physical activity before bed, opt for muscle stretches or practice simple yoga poses.

By following these simple tips, you can significantly improve your sleep hygiene and enjoy better quality sleep, which is crucial for your overall health and well-being.
