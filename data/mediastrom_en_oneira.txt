- Dreams: What They Mean and What They Reveal About Sleep Quality

Dreams are a fascinating experience that holds much mystery. This topic has intrigued humanity since ancient times and remains relevant in the 21st century. Dreams are enigmatic and supernatural, attracting the interest of Philosophy, Metaphysics, and Psychology.

The ancient Egyptians and Assyrians created one of the first dream interpreters around 2000-1500 BC, and the ancient Greeks also had their dream interpreters. Aristotle defined dreams as a mental activity, and later, Freud and Jung provided their interpretations. According to Jung, dreams adopt a different attitude than we follow in real life, while Freud believed that our dream life symbolizes repressed desires, 'censoring' the way we ultimately live.

- When and Why Do We Dream?

Most adults dream for more than 2 hours a night. Our sleep cycles through five different stages, and dreams can occur at any stage. However, the most vivid and intense dreams happen during the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) stage. Total sleep lasts from 90 to 110 minutes, with the REM phase occurring 70 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. As the night progresses, the duration of REM stages increases, while deep sleep stages decrease.

The REM stage is not only the realm of our dreams but also the phase needed by the brain to reboot and be efficient the next day. Let's take a closer look at the five stages of sleep.

- Sleep Stage 1: Light Sleep
We are between wakefulness and sleep, can be easily awakened, our eyes move slowly, and muscle activity decreases significantly. Upon awakening, one might recall fragmented visual images.

- Sleep Stage 2: Eye Movements Stop
Brain waves recorded by an EEG become slower, with occasional bursts of rapid waves.

- Sleep Stages 3 and 4: Deep Sleep
Stage 3 features extremely slow brain waves known as delta waves, interspersed with smaller, faster waves. In Stage 4, the brain almost exclusively produces delta waves. There is no muscle activity or eye movement in this deep sleep stage, making it very difficult to awaken someone.

- Sleep Stage 5: REM (Rapid Eye Movement)
Upon reaching Stage 5, breathing becomes rapid, irregular, and shallow. The eyes move abruptly in various directions, and muscles experience temporary paralysis. Heart rate and blood pressure increase. People awakened during REM describe strange and illogical stories, which are essentially their dreams.

- What About People Who Claim They Never Dream?

Individuals who assert they 'never dream' often describe their sleep as 'restless.' If you sleep on an uncomfortable mattress or in a poor sleeping position, the consequences can extend beyond back pain the next day. Consistently restless sleep affects dreams and cognitive performance. Discomfort in any part of the body can significantly impact your ability to sleep and reach the REM cycle (where dreaming occurs). This physical discomfort can lead to less REM sleep regularly, affecting your overall health. Thus, choosing the right mattress, sleeping position, and pillow is crucial!

- Dreams and Children: How They Affect Daily Life

Do children dream? The answer is 'yes,' and even from infancy. Experts say children have an active dream life, often dreaming more frequently than adults due to their experiences. Dreams help process new experiences and knowledge, aiding in better understanding the world around them. Thus, children continue to explore the world even while asleep.

The child’s brain holds memories, knowledge, and experiences, both positive and negative. For instance, a child might relive a confusing, challenging, or stressful situation through a dream. Children's dreams often feature protagonists and sometimes mix with reality, helping parents understand how their child perceives daily life.

Interestingly, children’s dreams differ based on gender and age. For example, children often dream of animals, with boys dreaming of wild animals and girls of pets. Girls dream of traveling in nature, while boys prefer adventures. Also, children experience nightmares, which make up about 25% of their dreams. As they grow, bad dreams significantly decrease. If nightmares persist, consulting a specialist might be necessary to address significant psychological concerns.

- Quality Sleep & Pleasant Dreams

- Choosing the Right Mattress and Sleeping Position for Better Dreams

Quality sleep is calm and comfortable. Sleeping on the wrong type of mattress can lead to persistent nightmares and other health issues. Similarly, a poor sleeping position can exacerbate musculoskeletal problems, making rest difficult. Strain on the spine can cause severe nervous imbalances throughout the body.

Given that one-third of our lives are spent sleeping, the surface—meaning the mattress—on which we sleep plays a vital role in determining our sleep quality and overall health. The better we sleep and the more relaxed we are, the more pleasant our dreams will be. The right mattress will allow you to fall asleep quickly and experience a deeper, more restful sleep throughout the night.

Choosing the right mattress is crucial as it ensures comfortable spinal alignment, resulting in less muscle and joint pain and eliminating disturbing nightmares caused by improper sleeping positions. The goal is a good, quality, sufficient sleep for a stronger immune system and good mental well-being every day!
