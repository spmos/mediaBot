 Sleep and Heatwave: 12 Tips from Experts for Better Sleep

High temperatures can make it difficult for the body to relax. Vogue has gathered useful tips to help you sleep better, even in heatwave conditions.

Is there anything more exhausting than not being able to sleep because of a stifling atmosphere? A hot bedroom is one of the biggest enemies of sleep. The ideal temperature for better sleep ranges between 16 to 21 degrees Celsius. When the temperature rises, so does the time spent tossing and turning in bed. Air conditioning is not suitable for everyone as it dries out the atmosphere and is harmful to the environment due to the energy consumed during the night.

However, there is always a solution. For those nights when there is no breeze and sleep becomes really challenging, here are some expert tips to help you relax both physically and mentally and cope with the heat.

Tips for Better Sleep

YES: Place a cold towel or ice packs in a plastic bag on your wrists and neck. This can significantly reduce your body temperature, says Neil Robinson, head of sleep at Sealy in the UK. Keeping these areas cool can trick the mind into thinking it's cooler. Alternatively, you can freeze water bottles and use them the same way.

NO: Do not leave windows open all day thinking it will lower the room temperature. Your room will actually be cooler if you keep the windows and curtains closed.

YES: Our extremities (hands and feet) help regulate our temperature. Cooling them can cool the whole body. Place a bucket of cold water next to your bed and dip your feet in it before lying down, suggests Robinson.

YES: Invest in high-quality cotton sheets to ensure your bed breathes as much as possible. Natural fibers allow air to move freely through the fabric, helping you stay cool at night, says Robinson. Linen is even better as it breathes more.

Tips
Take a cold shower before bed to lower your body temperature. If cold showers are not your preference, try lukewarm water, which can still reduce your temperature.

NO: Do not drink alcohol. It dehydrates your body before a challenging night, says Robinson, who also suggests drinking plenty of water before bed to avoid getting up during the night.

Sleep alone. Not only do our partners disturb us during the night, but their body heat makes sleep more difficult, says Robinson. Sleeping alone allows you to stretch out, helping your body escape the heat.

NO: Avoid consuming large amounts of protein as it increases metabolic rate, which can raise body temperature.

YES: Ensure you sleep on a good mattress. The surface you sleep on is as important as the sheets. A mattress can affect your body temperature. Look for mattresses made from smart fibers like cellulose, which have cooling properties, says Robinson.

NO: Do not exercise late at night. It raises your core body temperature, making sleep in high temperatures even more difficult. Robinson suggests exercising early in the morning to boost your metabolism and feel ready for the day.

YES: Maintain a consistent sleep schedule regardless of the weather. Heatwaves can tempt us to stay up later, enjoying an extra drink or two.

NO: Try not to nap during the day. While the heat can tire us out more easily, as the body uses more energy to regulate temperature, afternoon naps can make it even harder to sleep at night.
