Insomnia: Learn What Causes It and How to Manage It!

Did you know that:

- Many physical illnesses, especially those causing pain, discomfort, anxiety, or depression, are often accompanied by insomnia.

- The modern lifestyle is a major reason why more and more people suffer from sleep disorders. Due to lack of time and relaxation, people often do not get the sleep needed for rejuvenation. Various causes contribute to the development of different sleep disorders. Total sleep deprivation for a few days can lead to serious mental disorders, overexcitement, and physical exhaustion. A good night's sleep protects people from illnesses and increases life expectancy as it aims to rest both the body and the mind.

- The most common sleep disorders in the elderly are: insomnia, hypersomnia, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, sleep-related breathing disorders, and parasomnias.

Treatment of Insomnia

Regarding psychotherapeutic methods, they mainly aim at the following (Polyzopoulos 2013):

- Reducing autonomic hyperactivity
- Reducing physical signs of hyperarousal
- Controlling environmental stimuli so that the bedroom is associated with behaviors compatible with sleep and gaining 'confidence' in the ability to sleep adequately
- Dispelling patients' misconceptions about normal sleep needs
- Debunking unjustifiably negative views about the effects of insomnia
- Raising patients' awareness of the psychological mechanisms involved in the development and maintenance of insomnia.

Lastly, as for pharmacotherapy, it should be limited to the initial phase only as a supplementary treatment, to help the patient overcome the fear of not being able to sleep normally, but without making them reliant on sleep-inducing substances (Polyzopoulos 2013).

Finally, the most effective step you can take today is choosing the right mattress and pillow!
