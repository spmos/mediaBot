 Tips for a Good Night's Sleep

 1. New Sleep Duration Recommendations
Recent studies by the American Sleep Foundation (NSF) have led to updated guidelines for recommended sleep hours by age, creating two new age groups. These recommendations have also been adopted by the Hellenic Sleep Society.

 2. Sleep Quality and Age
As we age, we become more susceptible to the effects of stress, a heavy dinner, or the consumption of alcohol and caffeine, negatively impacting the quantity and quality of our sleep, according to sleep behavior specialist James Wilson.

 3. Sleep Patterns in the Elderly
Older adults tend to feel sleepy earlier in the evening and wake up early in the morning due to decreased melatonin production. According to research from the London Bridge Sleep Center, older individuals spend more time in lighter stages of sleep and thus wake up more easily and frequently during the night.

 4. Importance of Deep Sleep
Lack of deep sleep can hinder the brain’s ability to effectively clear toxins, affecting overall functionality, says Professor Barbara Sahakian from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge.

 5. Weekend Sleep Isn’t Enough
Weekend sleep cannot compensate for the sleep deficit accumulated during the week. This finding comes from researchers at the Hotel Dieu Sleep Center in Paris, led by Dr. Damien Leger, with the study published in Sleep Medicine.

 6. Sleep Quality Is in Our Hands
A study from Virginia Commonwealth University examined the sleep, lifestyle, and health of 3,284 adults, finding that behaviors within our control, such as reducing screen time and eating healthier, can improve sleep quality. The results were published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.

 7. Avoid Evening Exercise
Avoid intense exercise at least ninety minutes before bed. Late-night workouts might seem like a way to tire yourself out, but they can lead to restless sleep, says certified sleep science coach Stephen Light.

 8. Establish a Sleep Routine
Dr. Aneesa Das, a sleep specialist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, emphasizes the importance of maintaining a consistent sleep and wake schedule. Avoid long naps during the day, and if you must nap, limit it to 20 minutes to prevent nighttime insomnia.

 9. Let Go of Sleep Anxiety
Sleep is a natural biological process that can’t be forced. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) suggests that accepting wakefulness can help remove barriers to sleep. Shifting your focus to your breath and accepting wakefulness can help your mind relax and prepare for sleep.

 10. Practice the 4-7-8 Breathing Method
The 4-7-8 breathing method, which involves inhaling for four seconds, holding the breath for seven seconds, and exhaling for eight seconds, is known to promote relaxation and sleep. Focusing on your breath can divert your mind from stress and help you fall asleep.

 11. Get Morning Sunlight
Exposure to bright light in the morning can help reset your sleep schedule, making it easier to fall asleep at night and wake up feeling rested.

 12. Dim the Lights Before Bed
Artificial light at night disrupts the body’s circadian rhythm by suppressing melatonin production. Lower the lights before bed to help your body produce melatonin and prepare for sleep.

 13. Avoid Alcohol Before Bed
While alcohol might help you fall asleep, it can lead to poor sleep quality and a hangover the next day.

 14. Sleep-Friendly Foods
- Cherries: Contain melatonin, making them a perfect late-night snack for better sleep.
- Honey: Activates melatonin and deactivates orexin, a neurotransmitter that keeps you alert.
- Bananas: High in magnesium, which helps relax muscles and promote relaxation.

 15. Foods to Avoid for Better Sleep
- Chips: Avoid salty snacks before bed.
- Curry: Contains capsaicin, which raises body temperature and disrupts sleep.
- Ice Cream: Can spike blood sugar levels, leading to a crash that disrupts sleep.
