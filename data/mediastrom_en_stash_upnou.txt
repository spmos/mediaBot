 Correct Sleeping Posture: Learn How It Affects Our Sleep

On average, we spend one-third of our lives sleeping. Impressive? Indeed, and that's why we should ensure we enjoy our sleep both physically and mentally.

Sleeping posture reveals much about our health and character and significantly influences the quality of our sleep and overall mood. For instance, did you know that sleeping posture can be related to nightmares? Let's explore the correct body posture for better sleep and what your sleeping posture says about you.

 Sleeping Posture: What It Reveals About Our Health and When It Protects It

The right sleeping posture for a quality sleep is one that will rest our body, help us fall asleep faster, and sleep longer. According to experts, the posture we sleep in also reveals much about our general health:

- The posture we choose for years can cause musculoskeletal discomfort or intense pain.
- The way we sleep can indicate certain physical discomforts due to pathological causes.
- The fetal sleeping position facilitates breathing and is recommended for those with respiratory issues and sleep apnea episodes.
- Sleeping on the left side is considered more heart-friendly as it helps with better blood circulation.
- The fetal position often resolves issues for those prone to snoring, lower back pain, and neck pain. It helps the spine maintain its natural curves, which is why people with such health issues unconsciously choose it.
- Neurological diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's can be prevented or limited with the proper sleeping posture, according to recent studies from the State University of New York, Stony Brook. The same study highlights that side sleeping helps with better removal of harmful metabolic substances from the brain.
- Sleeping on your stomach strains the spine and worsens existing or emerging musculoskeletal problems.
- Sleeping on your back allows the tongue to block the upper airway due to gravity and other factors, leading to sleep apnea syndrome, a common cause of poor health due to sleep disturbances.

 The Correct Sleeping Posture for Better Sleep Quality

The best sleeping position for a quality sleep, according to experts, is on your left side. The second-best option is the fetal position for the reasons mentioned earlier.

Sleeping on the side, specifically the left side, relieves heartburn and is very helpful for those with stomach problems. Sleeping on the left side also allows gravity to help food move more easily from the small to the large intestine, aiding digestion.

Additionally, it effectively helps with snoring.

 Interesting Facts & Tips About Sleeping Posture

1. Sleeping on your back creates breathing difficulties, which can cause nightmares.
2. Changing sides while sleeping can contribute to better sleep quality.
3. Eating a meal—regardless of sleeping posture—late at night or before bed can disrupt sleep due to nighttime sweating and acid reflux, as the body works hard to digest food, sending signals to the brain to stay active.
4. If you want fewer wrinkles, sleep on your back so your face breathes evenly.
