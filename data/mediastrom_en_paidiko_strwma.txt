 How to Choose the Right Bed and Mattress for Your Child

The time has come when our child has grown enough, and the crib of infancy is now a thing of the past. Transitioning into early childhood brings the concern of choosing the right bed and ideal mattress for their physical development from now on. In fact, the mattress and bed choice we make during this period will likely be the one that accompanies them into their teenage years.

However, we must remember that infancy and childhood are periods where the body grows faster than at any other stage in life, and their sleep needs are truly significant. An infant sleeps about 15½ hours a day, a duration that gradually decreases. By the age of 8, they sleep around 9½ – 11½ hours. It is therefore very important that their mattress and bed are made of high-quality materials that ensure good sleep quality and health.

 What to Pay Attention To:

- Never use an older child's mattress or one borrowed from a friend or relative. An old mattress poses serious health risks for your child. For hygiene reasons and due to the mattress's anatomy, we should dismiss the idea of using a pre-used mattress. Buying a new one is the only option.
  
- The mattress must be comfortable and meet all hygiene requirements. It is good to trust a reliable and specialized mattress company to ensure we offer our child the best possible choice.
  
- The right mattress for our child's sleep should also be like the ideal mattress for everyone. It should provide comfort, adapt to, and 'follow' the natural curves of the child's body without pressing it and be appealing in feel for the child. In this context, we choose one that offers spinal support for quality sleep and a sense of embrace for relaxation and calmness. Remember, we want our children to love their sleep and their bed.
  
- Ensure the children's mattress is made from certified, natural, and friendly materials for the sensitive child's body. The mattress materials must be hypoallergenic, breathable, and specially treated to prevent dust mites and microorganisms that can cause allergies and respiratory issues.

 Choose the Right Pillow

The pillow, which is not recommended for infants, becomes a necessary addition for children, especially at ages when their torso grows rapidly. The ideal pillow for children supports the curve of the neck correctly, and it is important to change it relatively frequently to avoid the potential development of allergies in young children.
