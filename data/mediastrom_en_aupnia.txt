Insomnia: What to Do If You Can't Fall Asleep
Insomnia and difficulty sleeping. Insomnia is considered one of the most common sleep disorders, affecting about 1/3 of the general population and being more frequent in women. In fact, it becomes more problematic with age, as insomnia rates increase after the age of 60.

However, we have all experienced nights where we didn't sleep well or at all. The reason might have been increased stress, something that was bothering us or happening at that particular time. This doesn't mean we suffer from (chronic) insomnia. Let's clarify the blurry situation of insomnia and improve our sleep quality.

Insomnia: Causes, Definition, and Interpretation
Insomnia is related to frequent sleep disorders with impacts on a person's physical and mental health. It is the difficulty in falling asleep, staying asleep, or early waking despite the person's will, leaving a feeling of discomfort and stress during the day (about 10% of people with insomnia experience such symptoms during the day).

Temporary sleep difficulty, which usually improves within one to two days, cannot necessarily be considered insomnia. Essentially, insomnia is the consistent reduction of sleep quantity for a long period, regardless of whether the causes are apparent.

Causes of Insomnia
What can cause insomnia:

1. Anxiety disorders
2. Daily stress or a stressful period in life
3. Physical illness, especially if it causes pain and discomfort
4. Use of stimulants or other drugs and substances (the same applies to sudden cessation)
5. Environmental changes (the more stable the environment, the better the quality of sleep)
6. Changes in work schedule and daily routine
7. Medical conditions such as rhinitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), gastrointestinal disorders, arthritis, frequent urination, sleep apnea, etc.

In addition to the above, behavior and daily routines are connected to insomnia and either cause or exacerbate it. Thus, the type of work and corresponding schedule, napping, irregular sleep hours, lighting, noise, temperature, physical fatigue before bed, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, and psychology play a crucial role in sleep quality.

Insomnia: The Right Mattress and Pillow for Its Management
A bed, mattress, and pillow that are worn out or do not meet the needs of our body can lead to poor sleep and low sleep quality, thus causing insomnia. Naturally, insomnia is not solved only by the bed, mattress, and pillow, but they do improve it by resting the body more and not worsening any sleep disorder.

Choosing the right mattress and pillow for sleep. We choose a mattress based on our individualized needs (body build, pain in certain areas or some condition like neck pain or back pain) to be comfortable, appropriate in size, not restricting our movements, aligning our body (shoulders with the pelvis), and feeling as firm or soft as we desire. We try the mattress before making the final decision and consult one of the experienced and specialized Perfect Sleep Coaches at Media Strom for the appropriate choice.

Similarly, the pillow, although often overlooked, plays a critical role in quality sleep. We want it to be in good condition and of high quality. The best pillows on the market are made of memory foam, which adapts and maintains your unique shape, offering greater rest.

For any questions about choosing a mattress and pillow, don't hesitate to contact the Perfect Sleep Coaches at Media Strom.

Managing Insomnia: The Bonus Tip That Can Save You
Reading a book before bed. In 2009, the University of Sussex conducted research that found reading a book for about six minutes reduced stress levels by 68%, surpassing other activities like walking or having a cup of tea. Researcher and cognitive neuropsychologist Dr. David Lewis explained that this happens because continuous reading is more than just a distraction. Instead, it offers the opportunity for the individual to engage with the author's imagination and enter an altered state of consciousness, which relaxes the brain. Six minutes of reading a book that interests you is enough to significantly improve your sleep.
