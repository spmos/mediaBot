Sleep occupies 1/3 of our lives, and while it may seem like a period of relaxation, it is actually an extremely active time for the brain as it processes the vast amount of information received during the day. This makes the value of sleep even more important, not only for resting and rejuvenating our body but also for performing all the necessary processes that keep us strong and in control of our life quality.

However, medical science has highlighted that the inferior quality of life during our day and life may be due to sleep disorders, which are very common and profoundly affect our reactions, choices, dealing with issues in relationships, work, responsibilities, and even our own selves. The causes of these disorders are primarily neurological, although the quality and quantity of sleep can be affected by several non-neurological conditions such as anxiety, obesity, pregnancy, shift work, and potential cardiopulmonary diseases.

What are the sleep disorders?
- Insomnia
  - If you often find it difficult to fall asleep.
  - If you frequently wake up during the night and have trouble falling back asleep.
  - If you wake up very early in the morning without wanting to.
  - If you feel that your sleep is not refreshing.
  Do you notice that you belong to the category of people who experience this phenomenon intensely?
  Do you try to explain daytime sleepiness, fatigue, irritability, lack of concentration, and memory problems?
  Don't feel alone.
  Globally, about 50% of adults experience occasional insomnia episodes, while about 25% of the population in the western world suffers from chronic insomnia. Insomnia is about twice as common in women and the elderly.

  If you think you have insomnia, talk to a specialist doctor. In diagnosing insomnia, the patient's sleep diary kept for one or two weeks plays an important role, as does actigraphy, a tool that looks like a wristwatch, which the patient wears for 1-2 weeks, continuously recording the sleep-wake cycle. Insomnia may not require medication and can be treated by adopting appropriate sleep hygiene rules.

- Sleep Apnea Syndrome (SAS)
  Sleep apnea is a serious disorder that occurs when a person's breathing is interrupted during sleep, potentially hundreds of times. With sleep apnea, the flow of oxygen to vital organs is reduced, destroying normal sleep. It usually occurs in individuals of all ages, including infants and children.
  - If you often hear from your partner that your snoring is intense,
  - if you feel permanently tired during the day,
  - if you wake up suddenly with a feeling of gasping or choking,
  - if you suffer from dry mouth when you wake up,
  then it is correct to check the possibility of Sleep Apnea.

  In the case of small children, where symptoms may not be as obvious, consider if they suffer from sleep apnea if you observe:
  - Poor school performance,
  - Drowsiness or sleepiness (often misinterpreted as laziness in class),
  - Daytime mouth breathing and difficulty swallowing,
  - Unusual sleeping positions, such as sleeping on hands and knees or with the neck hyperextended,
  - Learning and behavior disorders,
  - Nighttime bedwetting.

  Treatment for mild cases of SAS may involve weight loss for overweight individuals, avoiding alcohol and sleeping pills that relax the airways during sleep, or even using dental appliances to help reduce airway obstruction. In more severe cases of apnea, a small mask can be applied to keep the airways open at all times.

- Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)
  Restless Legs Syndrome is a sleep disorder whose symptoms are often difficult to describe and may initially occur only once or twice a month, so many people do not inform their doctor about it. About 5% to 15% of the population suffers from Restless Legs Syndrome, which is an intense desire to move the lower limbs, often accompanied by sensations such as tingling, burning, pain, or cramps. People with RLS need to walk or move their limbs to relieve this unpleasant sensation. It affects all age groups (including children), but it becomes more common with age. It is 1.5 to 2 times more common in women and more intense during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester. In most cases, the cause is unknown, although there is evidence that heredity plays a crucial role, and iron deficiency is also a common cause.

- Parasomnias
  Parasomnias occur at specific stages of sleep or moments when we partially wake up. They are characterized by undesirable physical or verbal behaviors, such as sleepwalking or talking during sleep. The main types of parasomnias are nightmares, sleepwalking, night terrors, and sleep paralysis.

  - Nightmares:
    These are dreams during the REM sleep phase that can cause terror and anxiety, and the person can describe them in detail, usually having difficulty returning to sleep.

  - Sleepwalking:
    Occurs when the person appears to be awake and walking with open eyes while actually sleeping. Sleepwalkers do not remember their actions.

  - Night Terrors:
    A person suffering from night terrors wakes up suddenly from sleep, very frightened, with crying or screaming, rapid heartbeat, and sweating, unable to communicate. The night terror lasts up to 15 minutes, and immediately after, the person can go back to sleep. People who suffer from night terrors usually do not remember the events the next morning.

  - Sleep Paralysis:
    This is a common sleep disorder, occurring in 50% of people regardless of age and gender, where the person cannot move their limbs or call out, feeling helpless. Symptoms include:
    - Feeling of suffocation
    - Strong illusion that an intruder is somewhere in the room
    The explanation of the phenomenon is simple:
    When we sleep, our brain stops sending signals to the muscles and limbs to prevent physical reactions to dreams. For example, if we dream of running, the brain blocks the signals sent to the legs, so they do not perform the running motion. In sleep paralysis, the person regains consciousness from sleep just before the brain starts sending signals to the body again, experiencing a virtual paralysis, which usually lasts 20 to 30 seconds but can feel like an eternity.

Sleep disorders are common, even if temporary, for many of us. However, sleep medicine now has specialized neurologists, pulmonologists, and other medical specialties capable of diagnosing possible disorders in both young children and adults of all ages.
