- Sounds for Sleep: White Noises to Improve Your Sleep

If you suffer from insomnia, you’ve probably googled 'sounds for sleep.' Insomnia is a common disorder with various causes and significant impacts on mental and physical health, energy, performance, and productivity.

Those who struggle to sleep often try changing their daily habits. Some adjustments might include diet, exercise timing (morning or midday workouts are recommended over evening ones), reading a book before bed, removing screens, and avoiding blue light and doomscrolling. But there’s another interesting tip you might not know about: white noise! White noise isn’t just for putting babies to sleep; it can help adults too.

- White Noise: What It Is and How It Works

White noise is a combination of every frequency audible to the human ear at the same amplitude. It’s a continuous sound that includes every frequency detected by the human ear, from high to low tones. White noises combine various sound frequencies from 20 to 20,000 Hertz, a range perceivable by someone with normal hearing. Frequency refers to the number of sound signals, while amplitude is like the height of the sound wave.

White noise works by eliminating environmental noise. Practically, this means that any unwanted sound that might disturb our sleep stays out of our auditory field.

There are two types of white noise: high-tone and low-tone. High-tone white noise is harsh, whistling, and annoying, so it doesn’t help with insomnia. Low-tone white noise, however, relaxes us. Examples of white noises that can help us fall asleep and sleep well without interruptions include the sound of ocean waves, rain, a vacuum cleaner, a fan, or any monotonous sound that doesn’t draw much attention.

- Sounds for Sleep: The Most Suitable Ones

As mentioned, the best sounds for sleep are white noises that are monotonous and don’t attract much auditory interest. Most white noises that relax and help us sleep come from nature. The sound of the sea and waves, a breeze, rain, trees, and birds can put us to sleep as babies and continue to do so in adulthood. After all, don’t you always sleep better and earlier in the countryside compared to your usual sleep schedule in the city?

- Why Choose White Noise for Better Sleep

White noise relaxes, puts us to sleep, relieves daily stress or intense anxiety, and has many benefits, including:
- Improving memory
- Helping with language difficulties
- Facilitating neural communication in the brain
- Stabilizing the environment by balancing sounds reaching our ears
- Enhancing concentration
- Reducing the impact of a partner’s snoring by blocking the sound
- Helping babies sleep by mimicking the sound of blood flow in their mother’s womb

White noise serves many positive purposes and functions as a natural lullaby for both children and adults. However, if someone suffering from insomnia also deals with tinnitus, white noise might not achieve the desired result.

- Where to Find White Noise

There are many apps with white noise for you to experiment with. In recent years, devices that produce white noise for better sleep have become available. Start with a trial on a popular app, and if it works, look for the white noise source that suits you best.
