Truth or Myths? The Myths We Always Hear About Sleep!
Sleep is a valuable biological process and function of the body, which helps improve health, provides more energy, and naturally contributes to an overall positive outlook on life.

The beneficial properties of sleep are well-known for every age and every person. However, because it is a complex and intricate topic, especially when examined individually, there are many myths and truths surrounding it.

Truths and Myths About Sleep
5+1 Truths About Sleep You Should Pay Attention To
1. Sleepiness and lack of sleep are dangerous. Indeed, they can lead to reduced productivity, poor psychological mood, excessive fatigue, long-term health problems due to tiredness, and even accidents.

2. Delaying sleep for five or ten minutes with the snooze button wakes up fatigue rather than our body. This happens because the body doesn't have enough time to fall back into deep sleep, resulting in not feeling rested.

3. Sleep is part of the treatment for depression. Although it cannot yet be scientifically explained, many patients with depression seek sleep, which helps them feel better. However, excessive sleep is also an important early symptom of depression, prompting us to consult a doctor to help ourselves or someone we care about.

4. Quality sleep directly depends on the right mattress, which is made from quality materials (e.g., memory foam) and chosen based on our individual body needs.

5. The sleeping pillow should be appropriate, depending on the sleep position we maintain and the personalized needs of our body (e.g., neck pain, back pain) or the life phase we are in (e.g., pregnancy).

6. The anxiety that we will be tired the next day if we don't sleep sufficiently and well disrupts our sleep.

4+1 Myths About Sleep
1. Watching TV relaxes us and helps us sleep. The blue light, whether from the TV, mobile phone, or tablet, signals the brain that it is time to wake up, not rest.

2. As we age, we don't need as much sleep. Newborns up to three months need 14-17 hours of sleep/day, and infants need 12-15 hours of sleep. Toddlers aged 1-2 years need 11-14 hours of sleep, and children aged 3-5 years need 10-13 hours of sleep/day. Children aged 6-13 sleep an average of 9-11 hours/day, and teenagers aged 14-17 need 8-10 hours. Young adults aged 18-25 should ideally sleep 7-9 hours/day, and adults aged 26-64 and 65 and older should also sleep the same amount.

3. Insomnia only means not sleeping. Sleep expert Rebecca Robbins, a professor at the Department of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, emphasizes that excessive sleepiness and waking up tired are common complaints.

4. Sleep is not as important for good health and body function. Yet, sleep contributes to our daily reboot, invigorating the body and mind.

5. The bed mattress and sleeping pillow just facilitate the process, without contributing to more quality and deep sleep. The right sleep environment with low lighting, quietness, fewer noises, clean sheets, and the appropriate pillow and mattress for our individual body needs - which have not worn out over time - help in deep sleep and effectively combat insomnia, truly resting the individual.
