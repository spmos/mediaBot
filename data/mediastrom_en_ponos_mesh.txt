 Back Pain? The Solution is an Anatomical or Orthopedic Mattress

When discussing the terms 'anatomical' and 'orthopedic,' it's important to note that these descriptions are often used incorrectly. They typically refer to certain firm mattresses designed specifically for another person.

 Back Pain and Sleep

Back pain can significantly affect our daily lives, especially our sleep quality. Poor sleep quality, in turn, can exacerbate back pain, creating a vicious cycle where neither the sleep nor the pain improves. Experts emphasize that poor sleeping posture can either worsen existing back pain or even cause lower back pain (lumbago).

The good news is that there are solutions closely related to sleep, specifically the sleeping position we choose and the mattress that helps align and support the spine and head while absorbing pressure from the shoulders, legs, and pelvis.

 How a Mattress Can Help with Back Pain

A suitable mattress contributes to better sleeping posture and more restful sleep. For the human body to rest adequately, muscle contractions must be minimized without altering the bodyâ€™s natural shape. This can only happen if the entire body is supported by the mattress, filling every part with material. Essentially, we want the mattress to adapt to the body, not the body to the mattress, meeting the body's needs and providing supportive alignment for the spine and head while absorbing pressure from the shoulders, legs, and pelvis.

 Best Sleeping Positions for Back Pain Relief

Poor sleeping posture often causes or exacerbates back pain by putting undue pressure on the neck, hips, and back. The goal is to maintain the natural alignment of the body (head-shoulders-hips) and the natural position of the spine while lying down.

Certain sleeping positions can help maintain this alignment and are recommended for those suffering from back pain.

1. On Your Back with a Pillow Under Your Knees: This position distributes weight evenly across the largest surface area of the body, minimizes pressure points, and ensures good alignment of the head, neck, and spine. The pillow under the knees provides extra support to maintain the natural curve of the spine.

   Bonus tip for back pain: Avoid turning your head to the side, use one pillow to support your head and neck, and place a second, smaller pillow under your knees.

2. On Your Side with a Pillow Between Your Knees: This common position is recommended on the left side. However, it can put additional pressure on the spine without the proper mattress and pillow. Place a firm pillow between the knees to lift the upper leg and restore the natural alignment of the hips, pelvis, and spine.

   Bonus tip for back pain: Lie on your side, use a pillow to support your head and neck, slightly bend your knees, and place a pillow between them.

3. Fetal Position: This position relieves pressure as the knees are brought close to the chest, reducing the curvature of the spine and opening up the joints.

   Bonus tip for back pain: Lie on your side, use a pillow to support your head and neck, and bring your knees up towards your chest until your back is as straight as possible.

4. On Your Stomach: Sleeping on your stomach is considered the worst sleeping position, regardless of back pain. However, it can benefit those with herniated discs or degenerative disc disease. If you prefer sleeping on your stomach, there are two suggestions: with a pillow under the stomach or with the head facing down.

   - With a pillow under the stomach and hips: Place a thin pillow under the stomach and hips for better spinal alignment. Use a flat pillow for the head or try sleeping without a pillow for the head.
   - With the head facing down: Place your forehead on a large, rolled-up towel or a similar pillow. Add another pillow under the stomach and hips to lift the torso.

5. On Your Back in an Inclined Position: Sleeping in an inclined position, with the back raised, can help with back or lower back pain.
