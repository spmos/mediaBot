If asked whether sleep affects mood or mood affects quality sleep, where would you conclude?
The reality is that a bad mood can affect the quality of our sleep, and at the same time, a difficult night with poor sleep can negatively impact our mood in handling the day's demands. Which condition precedes the other is not entirely clear, but it doesn't particularly matter, since ideally, both factors should be at their best for our life.

Proper rest helps us regulate our emotions.

Those who sleep well are more optimistic, cheerful, happy, and energetic, as opposed to those who lack sleep and are grumpy, gloomy, and easily discouraged. Poor sleep leads to less emotional security and more intense reactions to negative situations. Sleep negatively affects attention and concentration, making us more impulsive, less able to handle conflicts, and less empathetic towards those around us. When we lack sufficient sleep, our emotional intelligence decreases significantly, and simultaneously, our ability to be well with others also diminishes.

Why does the lack of quality sleep cause psychological and behavioral problems?
Some reasons are obvious. For example, tired eyes are hyperactive and struggle to fall asleep. Additionally, sleep disturbance raises stress hormone levels, increasing stress for the next day. It also appears that sleep deprivation affects the brain's ability to process emotions and respond correctly to emotional stimuli. Specifically, using an electromagnetograph in related experiments, researchers found that those deprived of sleep showed inadequate communication between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex, which controls and sends inhibitory signals to the part of the brain related to the emotion area.

Recent research has even proven that continuous lack of sleep eventually causes depression. In fact, women are twice as likely to suffer from depression due to lack of sleep compared to men.

Four habits will improve both sleep and mood:
- Regular physical exercise
- Exposure to sunlight, especially in the morning
- Maintaining a routine
- Trying meditation

Poor sleep negatively affects relationships, social life, and connection with our loved ones. While it is no surprise that people struggle to sleep when emotionally tested, the relationship between mood disorders and quality sleep is bidirectional. Just as a negative mood can make good sleep seem like a fantasy, frequently insufficient and interrupted sleep can lead to intense anxiety. Regardless of what happens first, the conclusion is that bad mood and poor sleep are interlinked.
