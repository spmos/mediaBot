How Does Dinner Affect the Quality of Your Sleep?
Dinner affects the quality of our sleep depending on the timing and the foods we consume. In some cases, it negatively impacts sleep, while in others, it positively influences it. Therefore, the goal is not to skip dinner to sleep better, but to utilize it appropriately to benefit our body's rest.

It's worth noting that eating before bed helps prevent nighttime hypoglycemia, resulting in a more peaceful sleep. On the other hand, a heavy meal signals the circulatory system to send more blood to the digestive system, prompting the stomach to secrete more gastric acid, intensifying pancreatic function and the production of digestive enzymes. This causes disruption to the body when it needs calm to relax.

Food Before Bed: Which Foods Contribute to Quality Sleep
Every food is allowed, as long as we avoid excess and abuse. However, there are some foods that help us fall asleep more easily and contribute to better, quality sleep. Which are they?

1. Honey: Raw honey is an excellent snack before bed. It stimulates melatonin and deactivates orexin in the body. Orexin is the neuropeptide that makes us feel alert and awake. A cup of warm water, lemon, and honey is the perfect choice to calm the body after a difficult day and induce sleep.

2. Banana: Most of us enjoy it in the morning or after a workout as an excellent snack with rich benefits for our body. But did you know that the high magnesium levels in bananas naturally relax the body's muscles, facilitating rest?

3. Cherries: Although they are not available year-round, they have the ability to aid sleep due to the melatonin they contain.

4. Almonds: Their magnesium content regulates blood sugar while we sleep, allowing the body to naturally transition from the adrenaline cycle to the rest and digest cycle.

5. Turkey: Thanks to its high tryptophan content, an amino acid that acts as a natural mood regulator, turkey calms the body and mind, combating anxiety and ultimately providing a peaceful sleep. Other foods rich in tryptophan include brown rice, fish, and yogurt.

Dinner and Sleep: Frequently Asked Questions
1. How many hours before bed should I have dinner?
   Ideally, you should consume your last meal of the day three to four hours before lying down. This allows the digestive process to complete before bed.

2. What about nighttime cravings?
   Enjoy small, frequent meals throughout the day and don't stay hungry, so you don't overeat at night after work. If you get hungry one to two hours before bed, have a small snack, a fruit, or a glass of warm milk/chamomile.

3. Should I skip dinner?
   The goal is to lie down after completing digestion and not be hungry so you can sleep well. As mentioned earlier, consume your dinner before the body starts to relax. If you go to bed on an empty stomach, blood sugar levels drop, interfering with the body's ability to sleep well.

4. Are there ingredients that worsen insomnia or make it difficult to sleep?
   Some food ingredients negatively affect the sleep process. Such stimulants include caffeine, chocolate, sugar, alcohol, spicy foods (like seasonings and spices), and theophylline found in black tea.

5. Does a bedtime drink help induce sleep?
   A cup of warm water with lemon and honey or a glass of milk with a bit of honey is the perfect choice to calm the body and induce sleep.

Dinner Suggestions Before Bed
In general, we want a balanced diet rich in vitamins B, D, and Omega-3 fatty acids, calcium and magnesium, probiotics, and antioxidants. Let's make it simpler by suggesting some meals for dinner before bed.

1. Green salad or a seasonal salad with olive oil
2. Carbohydrates with a low to moderate glycemic index (e.g., brown rice)
3. A handful of nuts (e.g., almonds)
4. A herbal drink (e.g., mint, chamomile, verbena)
5. A serving of fruit
6. A turkey fillet with a green salad or seasonal salad

The Worst Foods Before Bed

1. Chocolate: The high caffeine and sugar content can cause more frequent occurrences of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.
2. Cheese: Strong or aged cheeses, as well as preserved meats like bacon, ham, and pepperoni, naturally contain high levels of the amino acid tyramine, which makes us alert.
3. Curry and other spicy foods: Professionals explain that capsaicin is the chemical that increases body temperature by interfering with the body's thermoregulation process, disrupting sleep. Your body will use more energy to digest the spices.
4. Ice cream and sugar: They increase blood sugar levels, which then inevitably crash when we lie down to sleep. The blood sugar crash signals the adrenal glands that there's an emergency, raising cortisol levels and waking the body from sleep.
