The supreme value of proper sleep is something we all understand, and there is an increasing number of scientific studies recognizing beneficial sleep as the most crucial factor for physical health and mental well-being.

To achieve beneficial sleep, however, we need to incorporate certain habits into our daily routine, the value of which we will realize from the first days of practicing them.

Whether we have trouble sleeping or fall asleep without realizing it, it’s good to try some breathing techniques. When we focus on our breathing by doing breathing exercises, we bring calm to our mind and body, leading to deeper and more meaningful sleep.

Although there are many breathing exercises, let’s keep in mind that whichever one suits us best, the important thing is that with controlled breaths, we provide more oxygen to our body, thus bringing balance.

Every 24 hours, we breathe automatically at least 20,000 times, and our nose processes 18-20,000 liters of air in total. Despite this, few of us pay the necessary attention to this vital function, and even fewer take care of our breathing systematically through specific exercises, except perhaps those involved in relaxation techniques.

Let’s get started:

Before beginning the exercises, it’s good to close your eyes to avoid distractions. And remember, inhalation always happens through the nose.

1. Breathing Exercise with Equal Inhalations and Exhalations
This technique is one of the most effective before sleep as it helps distract our mind from what stresses or bothers us.
- Sit comfortably
- Take 4 breaths through your nose, with your mouth closed
- Then exhale 4 times, again through the nose, with a closed mouth.
- Once practiced a few times, move to 6 to 8 inhalations and exhalations.

2. Breathing Exercise 4-7-8
- Exhale completely
- Take 4 consecutive breaths through your nose, without exhaling any air.
- Hold your breath for 7 seconds
- Count 8 exhalations through the mouth
- Repeat at least 4 times the first time. Try to eventually do up to 8 repetitions.
With this controlled breathing technique, you easily replenish oxygen in your body.

3. Three-Step Breathing Exercise
- Take a deep breath.
- Exhale as deeply as you can, trying to expel all the air from your body while focusing on how your body feels.
- After doing this a few times, slow down your exhalation to make it twice as long as your inhalation.

4. Breathing Exercise for Unloading and Deep Relaxation
- Lie on your back with your legs bent, feet flat on the floor, and arms at your sides.
- Calmly, slowly, and controlled, take a few long breaths, making sure your exhalation is through the mouth and lasts longer than the inhalation.
The duration of this exercise depends on when you feel relaxed and your energy is restored.

5. Alternate Nostril Breathing
- Sit cross-legged.
- Exhale completely, then close your right nostril.
- Inhale through your left nostril.
- Open your right nostril and exhale through it while closing your left nostril.
- Continue the rotation for 5 minutes, finishing by exhaling through your left nostril.
This technique reduces anxiety and brings psychological balance.

6. Papworth Breathing Exercise
- Sit comfortably or lie in your bed.
- Take deep, rhythmic breaths in and out, counting to 4 for each inhalation and each exhalation, which should be only through your nose.
- Focus on your abdomen, watching it inflate and deflate with each breath, and try to make your breathing audible from your stomach.
The Papworth method focuses on the diaphragm to help you breathe more naturally.
