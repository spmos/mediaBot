Change Your Sleep with Proper Nutrition and Psychology!
What are the conditions caused by a large meal that make it difficult for us to sleep?

A large and heavy meal signals the circulatory system to send more blood to the digestive system for digestion, causing the stomach to secrete more gastric acid, intensifying pancreatic functions and the production of digestive enzymes. In other words, when we consume a large and heavy meal, our body struggles to relax.

On the other hand, abstaining from food doesn't help either, as the brain isn't sufficiently supplied with glucose. A small snack an hour before bed, if you feel genuinely hungry, won't cause any issues. However, the ideal situation is to plan your last snack so you don't feel hungry 1-2 hours before you relax.

Foods that help with sleep:
- Rich in Omega-3: fatty fish (salmon, trout, mackerel, sardines), flaxseed oil, walnuts.
- Foods with a low glycemic index and a small amount of proteins.
- Dairy products that facilitate the concentration of tryptophan (an amino acid, precursor to serotonin, the sleep hormone).
- Legumes.
- After your meal, you can drink a relaxing beverage. Calming herbs like verbena, chamomile, and linden help you relax and have quality sleep.

Foods that hinder sleep:
- Certain components in foods like caffeine (coffee, chocolate, tea, some cola-type sodas) and theophylline (black tea) negatively affect sleep.
- Although alcohol acts as a sedative on the nervous system, when consumed at night, it results in poor-quality sleep.
- Spicy foods containing many seasonings and spices can cause indigestion and heartburn, which worsen when lying down. Since the digestive system slows down during sleep, consuming spicy food can lead to sleep problems.
- Finally, the consumption of liquids such as water, various juices, and other fluids should be reduced. Large liquid consumption can wake you up several times during the night to visit the bathroom. The ideal time to stop consuming liquids is 90 minutes before bed.

What can we do to improve our sleep?
1. Sleep Hygiene:
   According to the University of Maryland, good sleep routines can reduce negative symptoms (www.umm.edu). Some such routines include:
   - Going to bed when feeling sleepy.
   - Not consuming many liquids before bed.
   - Removing the clock and all electronic devices from the bedside.

2. Exercise:
   It's known that exercise increases the production of endorphins and the secretion of serotonin, which are responsible for creating euphoria and good mood. Regarding exercise and sleep, research findings are extremely interesting. A 2012 study showed that exercise has immediate and long-term benefits for sleep. Specifically, moderate exercise (walking, brisk walking) helps improve sleep quality by regulating glucose, reducing the feeling of fatigue, and reducing body weight, unlike very high-intensity exercise, especially during the evening, which often hinders the onset and maintenance of sleep.

3. Positive Approach:
   Optimism and humor are some characteristics that, when adopted, can be extremely useful skills for controlling stress and improving sleep. People characterized by pessimistic thoughts experience stress and anxiety more frequently and struggle more to find solutions. A positive approach to difficult situations can significantly reduce stress levels.
   Avoiding involvement in conflicts, better control of reactions and choices, internal analysis, and adopting a different logic play a crucial role in avoiding intense reactions that increase stress levels and, consequently, poor sleep quality.

4. Cognitive Therapy:
   Cognitive restructuring through cognitive therapy seems to play a significant role in modifying individual behavior, which can help change dysfunctional thoughts before sleep (overthinking, rumination), recognizing and understanding feelings, and accepting what one feels. A related study showed that cognitive restructuring helped reduce the time individuals were awake and normalize insomnia symptoms. It is a structured and organized therapeutic approach in which the stressed individual learns to identify, evaluate, and change dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs that are considered causes of psychological disturbance.

In conclusion, the quality of sleep reflects our mental state and physical health. It is important to start with thought patterns to establish healthy sleep behavior for life.
