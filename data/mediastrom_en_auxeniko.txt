Cervical Syndrome: Choose the Right Pillow and Reduce Symptoms
Cervical syndrome is a set of problems that appear in individuals aged 25-30 and older. What the general public doesn't know is that cervical syndrome presents symptoms not only in the neck but also in the surrounding areas (from the shoulders to the arms and fingers).

As for the main causes? If there is no injury or conditions such as discopathy, herniated discs, and vertebral tumors, then most of the time, it happens as you might expect! The modern sedentary lifestyle and endless hours in front of a screen do not help our neck and often burden it. It's worth noting that cervical syndrome may also be observed in individuals whose work involves frequent lifting of weights.

Cervical Syndrome and Symptoms: These Are the First Signs
The first symptoms of cervical syndrome are intense pain in the neck area and a form of stiffness. These can be located in the neck and extend to the shoulders, arms, and fingers. Headaches are also a frequent symptom of cervical syndrome. Many patients also report dizziness and vertigo, which reduces their quality of life in daily activities.

The issue with these symptoms is that they can easily confuse the patient since they are common and often attributed to other causes such as daily stress, long hours on the computer, or fatigue. This intensifies the problem of cervical syndrome, and the diagnosis is not made in time for immediate and effective treatment.

Pillow for Cervical Syndrome: A Valuable Ally in Our Bed
Cervical syndrome requires simple, practical but well-thought-out solutions, which we should apply daily and integrate long-term into our lives. A valuable ally for the management and prevention of cervical syndrome is the pillow. An anatomical sleeping pillow for cervical syndrome will support our neck while we sleep, ensuring the proper position of the spine and protecting sensitive areas, providing a restful sleep and a refreshed awakening.

Cervical Syndrome – Correct Neck Position
The Aloe Anatomic sleeping pillow follows the neck for comfort and proper support. Besides its ergonomic design, it also features Aloe Vera extract. A soft scent that predisposes us to relaxation and invigorates the body and mind while we sleep. When we talk about sleep, everything is connected and creates the right atmosphere for ideal rest from a demanding daily routine.

Using the right pillow is essential for relieving neck pain. This is because a pillow that conforms to the lordosis of the cervical spine and supports the head is ideal for preventing neck pain.

Cervical Syndrome: 5+1 Practical Tips for Better Sleep
1. Avoid using a very high or rigid pillow that keeps the neck bent.
2. If you sleep on your side, keep your spine straight.
3. For patients with chronic neck pain, a pillow that maintains the correct cervical curve of the neck can reduce neck pain and significantly limit headaches.
4. Prefer smaller and ergonomic neck pillows, both for sleeping and resting (e.g., while watching TV).
5. If you sleep on your side, place a pillow between your legs at knee height.
6. If your favorite sleeping position is on your stomach, reconsider, as this position requires the head – and thus the neck – to be turned to the right or left side, not straight.

Bonus info: Keep screens (e.g., computer, mobile phone, or tablet) at eye level to avoid bending down to use them, which strains your neck.
