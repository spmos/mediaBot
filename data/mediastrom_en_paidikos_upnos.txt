 Improving Children's Sleep: Lullabies, Sleep Routines, and More Tips

Children's sleep is a topic on its own, which is why there are sleep experts specializing in children. When a child doesn't sleep well, it affects both the parents and the child, who doesn't know how to fall asleep despite feeling tired.

 What Does It Mean for a Child to Sleep Well?

Good children's sleep means the child falls asleep within the first twenty minutes of lying down, sleeps early at night (the same applies to naps), and sleeps continuously without interruptions, waking up in the morning. However, sleep disorders in school-aged and preschool children (and of course in infants) are common. That's why we need a sleep routine and some additional tips to improve children's sleep.

 Sleep and Children: What Is the Right Sleep Routine?

The first thing pediatricians recommend is for the child to learn to sleep independently. This means the child should not fall asleep with the parents, as waking up in the middle of the night and realizing mom and dad are not nearby can make the child extremely anxious, disrupting their sleep.

A sleep routine for children should be consistent and stable. Every night, the child should go to bed at the same time, including weekends. Before bedtime, the child should engage in a relaxing process such as a warm bath, a light massage with cream or oil, dim lighting, white noise in the room, and a bedtime story or their favorite fairy tale. It's important for the child to recognize, as they grow, that this routine signals it's time to relax and sleep.

The evening meal, the last meal of the day, should be light depending on the child's age. Avoid large quantities of food that can weigh down the child, just as it does for adults, but also avoid too little food, as hunger can significantly hinder sleep. Both the quantity and timing of the evening meal require attention, with a consistent time every day.

The traditional technique of lullabies is timeless and has proven beneficial for children's sleep. A sweet melody heard every night from the mother or father can make a child feel secure, develop positive feelings during the lullaby, relax, and bond more with the parent. Lullabies can transform a child's negative feeling about sleep into a positive one, which is valuable for improving sleep. Additionally, lullabies familiarize children with language, reduce anxiety, improve memory (especially with daily repetition), enhance focus, and contribute to cognitive development.

 Children's Bed and Mattress: How They Improve Sleep

The sleep environment plays a crucial role for both adults and children. A calm room with dim lighting, free from loud noises but with soothing melodies or white noise, away from screens and blue light that suppresses melatonin and delays sleep, is ideal for helping a child relax.

 Choosing the Right Children's Bed and Mattress

Beds should be safe, durable, and of the right dimensions so they don't need to be replaced soon due to the child's growth. The bed should be appealing to the child and ideally chosen with their input so they enjoy spending time in it.

As we've emphasized in our articles, sleep is an experience for infants and children, and we at Media Strom want this sleep experience to be extremely pleasant and healthy. The mattress should be made of high-quality materials and ideally be of medium firmness since soft mattresses hinder children's movements and hard ones are uncomfortable. Additionally, the mattress should provide the proper support for the child's spine as their muscles develop.

Choose a mattress cover made of natural cotton to avoid allergies and ensure it is easily removable for regular washing. Avoid mattresses with rubber or plastic overlays, as children are more sensitive than adults to harmful substances. Mattresses should guarantee they are free from health-damaging chemicals (plasticizers, solvents, flame retardants, etc.). Don't neglect a protective cover, which prevents moisture and air renewal and is 'life-saving' for younger children who might easily soil the mattress.

Don't hesitate to ask a Perfect Sleep Coach from Media Strom for the right children's mattress based on your child's needs.

 4+1 Extra Tips for Lulling Children to Sleep

1. If your child is an infant, ensure they stay awake for at least two hours between short naps during the day.
2. If nap time has passed, opt for an activity that will awaken the child rather than letting them sleep late in the afternoon.
3. Observe the child to recognize early signs of sleepiness (e.g., yawning, restless movements, irritability, instability, intense crying, rubbing eyes).
4. Place the baby in the crib and the older child in the bed when they are sleepy but before they fall asleep.
5. Calm the child experiencing 'separation anxiety,' especially if they are between 9-12 months old. Gradually, the child will feel secure and regulate their sleep between 12-18 months.
