   9. Are there general signs of wear and tear?
   10. Would you be embarrassed if your neighbors saw your mattress without a cover?

2. The position we prefer to sleep in is a criterion for choosing the appropriate type of mattress.

   For example:
   - Firm mattresses are generally not recommended as they used to be for proper sleep. They were commonly used for back sleeping.
   - Medium-firm for those who sleep on their stomach,
   - Softer for those who sleep on their side.

3. Proper maintenance of the mattress is as important as choosing the right one. Therefore, a proper protective cover extends the life of your mattress to the level it was on the first day you received it. This way, you increase its lifespan and protect the environment where you spend one-third of your life!

4. According to Professor Idzikowski, a sleep expert consultant, only 5% of people use a different position every night.

5. The way you sleep reveals much about your personality!

   Professor Chris Idzikowski has dedicated much of his time to studying sleep. Specifically, he studies the relationship between sleep posture and personality. He analyzed six common positions people use in these situations and is convinced that they are associated with a specific behavior pattern.

   A. Fetal Position
   According to Idzikowski's findings, 41% of people sleep in this position. It's the same posture we have in our mother's womb. More than half of women sleep this way!

   B. Log Position
   15% of people sleep this way. It's a side position with legs stretched out and arms down by the sides. People who sleep in this position are open and sociable. They also tend to have leadership tendencies but can also be somewhat naive.

   C. Yearner Position
   13% of people sleep this way. This means they have their arms outstretched in front of them, forming a right angle. In these cases, the person usually has a reserved personality.

   D. Soldier Position
   The name of this position is 'the soldier' because the person sleeps on their back with their body stretched out and arms down. People who are shy and introverted sleep this way. They also follow routines and rules but are also very dynamic.

   E. Freefall Position
   These make up 7% of people. It's the position where the person hugs a pillow with their arms and turns their head to one side. Those who sleep in this position are anxious and nervous.

   F. Starfish Position
   About 5% sleep on their back with their arms spread out above their head. This sleeping position is preferred by altruists. They are open to listening to those around them and make friends quickly. Finally, they are individuals who avoid being the center of attention.

By identifying your sleep posture and understanding its implications, you can make informed decisions about your mattress and overall sleep environment, leading to better rest and improved well-being.
