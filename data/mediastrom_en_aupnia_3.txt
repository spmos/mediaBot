- Dentists, by evaluating anatomical features in their patients' mouths, can suspect sleep apnea and help in its diagnosis.
- Sleep apnea can be effectively treated by appropriately trained dentists using specially designed intraoral splints.
- Patients with sleep apnea who struggle with CPAP devices can benefit significantly from an intraoral splint.

If you have or suspect you have issues with snoring or sleep apnea, consult a suitably specialized dentist. The dental treatment for sleep apnea is permanent and lifelong. For it to be effective, it must be performed by the right dentist, and the patient must be regularly monitored to make the necessary adjustments to the splint and maintain its function over time.

Intraoral splints for treating apnea have been used internationally with great success for over 20 years. These splints mechanically keep the airway open by holding the lower jaw and indirectly the tongue in a position that prevents it from falling back toward the pharynx and causing apnea. This is a proven effective method that fully treats the problem when apnea is mild to moderate in severity but is also indicated for patients with severe issues who cannot tolerate a CPAP device. The advantages of this treatment, besides its effectiveness, include patient comfort and easier acceptance.
