Insomnia During Pregnancy: Combat It with the Right Pillow
Insomnia is generally more common in women than in men, especially during pregnancy. This is a particularly unique phase for women, during which they feel fatigued all day but experience insomnia when it's time to sleep. In fact, research indicates that about 70% of women report experiencing insomnia during pregnancy (at least in one of the three trimesters).

Insomnia & Pregnancy
What does 'insomnia during pregnancy' mean? Practically, it means either you don’t want to sleep or you can’t. It can also mean waking up multiple times during the night or waking up and not being able to fall back asleep. Simply put, there is a significant drop in sleep quality, while the woman has an increased need for good and, most importantly, quality sleep.

Pregnancy and Sleep: Why Increased Insomnia is Observed
The reasons causing insomnia during pregnancy are both physical and psychological. Regarding physical symptoms, they include:

- Frequent urination and the general need for frequent nighttime visits to the bathroom
- Difficulty breathing
- Weight gain
- Mastodynia, meaning pain, discomfort, or increased sensitivity in the breasts
- Nasal congestion caused by increased estrogen levels that increase blood volume, including the vessels in the nose, causing swelling and thus congestion
- Nausea, vomiting (especially in the first trimester)
- Back or lower back pain due to weight and belly increase
- Abdominal discomfort (including heartburn caused by gastroesophageal reflux)
- Leg cramps, which are common in pregnant women
- Hormonal changes occurring in the woman's body

There are also psychological causes, primarily due to the woman's concerns about childbirth and life with the baby. The joy of the new family member is immense. However, the expectant mother fears the childbirth process and has increased stress about balancing motherhood with professional or personal life. Another cause of insomnia during pregnancy that disrupts a woman's sleep is dreams, which are naturally linked to the pregnant woman's good or bad mood based on the factors mentioned above.

It is worth noting that the lack of sleep during pregnancy does not affect the fetus but only tires the woman. This inadequately prepares her for childbirth and the inevitable fatigue afterward.

Insomnia During Pregnancy: How to Combat It!
The solutions to insomnia during pregnancy are revealed through small changes in the pregnant woman's daily habits. It is important to stay active throughout the day to be tired at night. If you still can’t sleep, experts suggest getting up and engaging in an activity. This way, you will tire yourself out and facilitate the sleep process.

Make sure to drink plenty of water, ideally until 8 PM, and avoid caffeine in the afternoon. Eat small, frequent meals, with light snacks for dinner.

One of the most well-known tips for insomnia, regardless of pregnancy, is to create the right sleep environment. This means setting up a restful environment. Ideally, we want a room temperature of 18-24 degrees Celsius. Establish a sleep routine with a relaxing warm bath, possibly listening to easy listening music, keeping the lights low, wearing comfortable clothes, and enjoying a warm chamomile or caffeine-free tea.

Finally, don’t say 'no' to power naps during the day for about half an hour. This way, you will rest without sleeping too much, preventing nighttime insomnia.

Sleep During Pregnancy and the Right Sleep Position
The appropriate sleep position during pregnancy is ultimately the one that is most comfortable for the woman. The goal is to sleep comfortably. However, there are specific recommendations for the right sleep position during pregnancy. In the first trimester, the expectant mother can rest in any position she prefers since her belly is still small.

In the second trimester, the guidelines change as the woman's physical needs change. Avoid sleeping on your stomach, especially after the 16th week of pregnancy, as this position compresses the uterus and arteries and is generally uncomfortable as the belly grows.

Although many women choose to sleep on their back during the second and third trimesters, experts recommend sleeping on the side. Side sleeping is the best choice during these trimesters, especially after the 20th week of pregnancy. In the third trimester, the belly is quite large, so side sleeping, ideally on the left side, is recommended. Sleeping on the left side is considered safe as it ensures adequate blood flow to the placenta and kidneys. However, this recommendation does not mean that sleeping on the right side has negative effects.

A valuable ally for quality sleep during pregnancy is the pillow. It’s important to use a pillow that supports the body properly. Pillows are essential during pregnancy and sleep. A pregnant woman needs a comfortable pillow to support her neck and spine, a pillow between her legs to relieve her back, and possibly an additional pillow for her back, depending on her preferred sleep position.
