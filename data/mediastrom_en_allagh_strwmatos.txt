Sleep Changes When the Mattress Changes!
How often should we change our mattress? This is a question we often hear from those of you who are interested in knowing when it is recommended to change your mattress for reasons of hygiene, health, and sleep quality. We know that the mattress is linked to health and hygiene. We also know that the right sleeping mattress we choose will offer us better quality sleep from which we will wake up rested and full of energy. However, what we do not pay much attention to is the timing for changing the mattress.

4+1 Things We Don't Know About Our Mattress
1. When it has lumps, stains, and simply forms dips every time we lie down, it's time for a change.
2. Often it's the old mattress that creaks, not the bed.
3. The mattress bears significant responsibility if we wake up stiff and tired.
4. An old mattress disturbs not only us during sleep but also whoever sleeps with us. Every time one person moves, the other is disturbed because of the mattress.
5. Besides the unpleasant smell, an old mattress stops being as cool and comfortable.

Why Change My Mattress Every 7 Years
The numbers speak for themselves when it comes to 'changing a mattress.' Seven years of a mattress means 20,000 hours of use, 360 liters of sweat on it, and 3 kilograms of dead cells that feed dust mites. We remind you that these mites cause allergies and other health problems if they are present. Therefore, if you don't remember when you bought or changed your mattress, or if you notice any of the above symptoms, don't forget the benefits of a new, fluffy, cool mattress!
