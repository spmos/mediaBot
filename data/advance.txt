Matress 'Advance':
Ideal support
The Non stop sleep technology is an innovative technology of independent springs by Media Strom. The independent springs adapt to the movements of the body, properly distributing the pressure all over the body. They are ideal for two people as they absorb the shock from each other's physical movement. The independent springs are a spring technology which Media Strom has adopted for all of their mattress lines.

Antimicrobial mattress fabric processing (sanitized) ensures a healthy sleeping quality throughout the lifetime of the Advance mattress you will choose.
