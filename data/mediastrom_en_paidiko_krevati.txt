### How to Choose the Right Children's Bed and Mattress

Children, especially up to the age of six, spend almost half of their infancy and childhood in their bed and on their mattress. Therefore, sleep is crucial for their health, growth, rest, mental well-being, and energy levels. Sleep is an experience for infants and children, and we want this sleep experience to be exceptionally pleasant and healthy!

#### Choosing the Right Children's Bed

Infants and children spend a lot of their lives in their bed and on their mattress because their bodies grow rapidly, and the need for quality sleep is truly vital.

Three essential characteristics we look for in a children's bed are safety, comfort, and convenience. Firstly, it should be sturdy and comfortable in its dimensions, so it doesn't need to be replaced soon due to the child's growth. This means that once the child gets used to their bed, no further changes will be necessary.

A valuable tip is the use of a removable cover. Children aged three to four years transition from their crib and need to explore the new world their bed offers through lots of play. Removable covers allow for endless play without concerns about minor injuries from bed corners or accidents involving food, markers, or even natural needs. A covered children's bed serves many purposes, keeping the child's sleep environment clean, safe, and comfortable while extending the bed's lifespan by protecting it from wear and scratches.

The goal is for exploration and play to be an enjoyable experience for the child without restrictions. This will contribute to the child's proper development, boost their confidence, and give them additional independence. Finally, make the bed selection process even more enjoyable by choosing the bed together with the child. It's important that they like it so they will enjoy spending time in it.

#### Sleep Routine for Children: 9+1 Tips for Better Sleep

1. Maintain a consistent sleep routine in terms of timing, ensuring the child goes to bed at the same time every day.
2. Do not deviate from the sleep schedule, even on weekends.
3. Give them a bath one to two hours before bedtime.
4. Sit with them until they fall asleep, especially if they are under six years old.
5. Offer a light snack in a small quantity before bedtime.
6. Reduce noise in the sleeping environment.
7. Create a relaxing atmosphere with low lighting, white noise, away from screens (blue light from TV, mobile, tablet), and a few toys (ideally just a 'lovey') to signal that it's sleep time, not playtime.
8. Remember that the earlier a baby or child wakes up, the earlier they will go to bed. Maintain the same morning wake-up times for a consistent biological clock.
9. Choose a high-quality children's mattress and consult experienced and specialized Perfect Sleep Coaches at Media Strom.
10. Avoid linking the child's sleep with your own. Children who sleep with their parents may wake up with separation anxiety and may struggle with sleep if they don't see their parents nearby. Therefore, your dependency on your child's sleep won't help them sleep better.

#### Choosing the Right Mattress for Your Child

A children's mattress should be characterized by high-quality materials to ensure the child's health and the corresponding good quality of sleep. Experts recommend a medium-firm mattress for children since soft mattresses make it difficult for children to move, and firm ones are uncomfortable. Additionally, a children's mattress should provide proper support for the child's spine as their muscles develop. Babies and older children do not need mattresses of different firmness, so a single mattress can be used for up to the first five years of their life.

Another crucial factor for parents to consider when choosing a children's mattress is hygiene. This involves both the materials from which the mattress is made and its durability if it gets soiled. Since children are more sensitive than adults to harmful substances and spend many hours in their room, the mattress should be certified free of health-damaging chemicals (plasticizers, various solvents, flame retardants, etc.). Opt for an outer fabric made of natural cotton to prevent allergies and use a mattress protector to avoid accidents.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your child has a comfortable, safe, and healthy sleep environment, supporting their overall well-being and development.
