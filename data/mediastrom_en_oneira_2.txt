September, Month of 'Sleep and Dreams'

- Polygraphic studies from the Pneumonology Clinic at the University of Thessaly have shown that using a Memory Foam Media Strom sleep pillow can reduce snoring incidents by 40%! Participants in the study experienced quieter sleep, with less snoring and fewer position changes. So, say goodbye to snoring with a Memory Foam Media Strom pillow.

- Harvard Medical School tips for choosing a sleep pillow:
  1. Avoid using very high or stiff sleep pillows, which keep the neck bent during the night and can lead to morning pain and stiffness.
  2. If you sleep on your side, keep your spine straight by using a sleep pillow that is higher under your neck than your head.

- Time spent dreaming: If we live to be 70 years old, we will have spent 50,000 hours or about 6 years dreaming. This is approximately 10% of our life!

- Adults naturally wake up when dreaming during sleep, so if you woke up without an alarm or other disturbance this morning, you are likely to remember your last dream. Generally, if you never remember your dreams, you are probably sleeping well.

- Nightmares create a bad feeling the next day, something that can be called a hangover, affecting our productivity, mood, and behavior.

- Short sleepers: There are people, known as short sleepers, who can function with less than 6 hours of sleep each day. This ability has a genetic basis and is extremely rare, affecting only about 1% of the population.

- Less sleep makes you more like Scrooge! Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, led by neuroscientist Eti Ben Simon and psychology professor Matthew Walker, showed through three different experiments that people are less willing to help others after a night of poor and insufficient sleep. This tendency for reduced generosity was also confirmed on a large scale when researchers found that after the annual time change in the U.S., the amounts of charitable and other donations from about three million people decreased by about 10% when the time moved forward by an hour.
