If in the first trimester of your pregnancy you constantly feel sleepy and go to bed early, from the second trimester onwards, you may experience difficulties in sleeping, even insomnia, even if you have never had any sleep disorders until now.

Insomnia during pregnancy is a completely normal condition and appears to affect about 75% of pregnant women. It is due to both psychological causes (anxiety, worries about the upcoming baby) and physical causes (the enlargement of the uterus and the growing belly may cause breathing problems that make sleep difficult).

If you want to improve your sleep, you can follow these tips:
1. Exercise: According to scientific research, pregnant women who engage in mild exercise sleep more easily. Consider prenatal yoga, pilates, or swimming.
2. Watch Your Diet: Follow a healthy diet and avoid foods that cause heartburn or reflux.
3. Wait Before Bed: Go to bed at least one hour after your last meal. Allow enough time to stay seated before lying down.
4. Limit Fluids: Frequent urination is a common problem during pregnancy. To avoid waking up for nighttime bathroom visits, drink plenty of fluids during the day but limit them a few hours before bed.
5. Avoid Caffeine: Mainly avoid coffee, tea, and caffeinated soft drinks. Insomnia is another characteristic of pregnancy, so there's no reason to worsen it with stimulating drinks. Try to relax, avoid stressful thoughts, and go to bed calmly.
6. Establish a Sleep Routine: Routines aren’t just for children but help during pregnancy too. Try to sleep at the same time every night after a relaxing bath.
7. Relax Before Bed: Avoid intense activities before sleep and prefer to read a book or get a relaxing massage from your partner if you’re lucky.
8. Take a Warm Bath and Drink Milk: Soon, you’ll be bathing your baby and giving it milk every night before bed. Follow the same routine yourself, and you’ll sleep like a baby!
9. Use Support Pillows: Many expectant mothers find special pillows that support the belly during sleep very comfortable. These pillows will also be useful later for breastfeeding.
10. Remove Electronic Devices: We don’t mean a complete move, but remove items like noisy clocks or devices with blinking lights that prevent you from relaxing.
11. Sleep on Your Left Side: Doctors advise pregnant women to sleep on their left side, as this position is considered best for both mother and baby. You can also use a pregnancy pillow for added comfort.
12. Truly Rest Your Body: Ensuring your comfort and choosing the right mattress and pillow is essential. Remember to always have enough space in bed to stretch out and get comfortable.

By following these tips and making small adjustments to your daily habits, you can significantly improve your sleep quality during pregnancy.
